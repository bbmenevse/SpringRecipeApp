# Spring Boot Recipe Application

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/springframeworkguru/spring5-recipe-app.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/springframeworkguru/spring5-recipe-app)

This is an exemplary app that I am building alongside a course I purchased from Udemy, which you can check out [here.](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/)
I forked this app from the base and built it on my own, following the course but with some modifications. You can check out the original version [here.](https://github.com/springframeworkguru/spring5-recipe-app)
