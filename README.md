This is an examplery app that i am building alogside course I got from Udemy, which you can check on [here.](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/).
I branched this app from the base and built it on my own along with the course but with changes. You can check the original [here.](https://github.com/springframeworkguru/spring5-recipe-app).
